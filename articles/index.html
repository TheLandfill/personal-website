			<h3>How to Discover Finite Fields While Bored in Class</h3>

			<h3>The Road to Quantum Mechanics</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>It's a long road to understanding Quantum Mechanics, and there
			are no shortcuts. In this series, I'll show you everything you'll
			need to understand Quantum Mechanics. This series will also serve
			as a good discussion of many major topics in Classical Mechanics.
			I'm also putting the honorable mention <a
			href="https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/approaches-to-solving-problems-in-physics-295a45ad45a7?source=friends_link&sk=0e96547e313cf181c875bcbb206bbe06">Approaches
			to Solving Problems in Physics</a> in this section because it's a
			great precursor to the rest of the series.
			</p>
			<h4>Intro and Newtonian Mechanics</h4>
			<p>In this first arc, we set up the goals of the series along with a
			general plan for the series (we repeatedly modify this plan
			based on what I find informative). We also set up Newtonian
			Mechanics, our first approach to Physics.

				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Partial Differential Equations</h4>
			<p>In this second arc, we derive Poisson's Equation, Laplace's
			Equation, the Heat Equation, and the Wave Equation. We then discuss
			the two main methods of solving these PDEs that will generalize to
			Quantum Mechanics: eigenfunction expansions and the method of
			Green's Functions. We also discuss a lot of the mathematical
			background for these methods, which includes introducing Bra-Ket
			notation and projection operators.

			<h4>Lagrangian Mechanics and Electromagnetism</h4>
			<p>In this third arc, we work on converting Newtonian Mechanics into
			a form that works in arbitrary coordinate systems. We first do so by
			introducing Differential Geometry, then using Differential Geometry
			to derive Lagrangian Mechanics from first principles. From there, we
			talk about the Principle of Least Action and apply it to several
			systems. We then extend the Lagrangian to work with
			velocity-dependent forces like magnetism and fields. In studying
			these concepts, we eventually derive Special Relativity. We end by
			talking about Noether's Theorem.

			<h4>Hamiltonian Mechanics</h4>
			<p>In this fourth arc, we then talk about Hamiltonian Mechanics.
			Usually, Hamiltonian Mechanics is treated like a necessary evil to
			get to the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation and only the bare minimum is
			covered. To remedy this problem, we'll cover Hamiltonian Mechanics
			in far more depth. We won't be wasting your time, though, as every
			concept introduced in this arc will show up somewhere in Quantum
			Mechanics or is necessary for a concept that shows up somewhere in
			Quantum Mechanics.

			<h4>Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics</h4>
			<p>In this final arc, we talk about Thermodynamics and Statistical
			Mechanics. We'll start by talking about Classical Thermodynamics
			before Statistical Mechanics, which covers concepts like heat
			engines, the phases of matter, chemical reactions, etc. Then, we'll
			introduce Statistical Mechanics and see how we can, in principle,
			replicate all these results.

			</ol>
			<p>I have no idea how much this section will change or how I'm going
			to chop these concepts up into articles, so while the topics I want
			to cover won't change, the articles will. I'm probably going to add
			more and rearrange these topics.
			</p>
			<h4>Appendix</h4>
			<p>In this section, we talk about topics that we should cover before
			we get to Quantum Mechanics, but don't really fit anywhere in the
			main body of the series.
			</p>
			<ol type="i">
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.cantorsparadise.com/an-intro-to-topology-9e0478313b63?source=friends_link&sk=ebf03da0d56777bb635f32907a46fb7e">An Intro to Topology</a>

				<li>An Intro to Complex Analysis (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This list is bound to change multiple times as I'm going to
			rearrange the order of the topics and move topics around within the
			articles. For example, I might combine two articles, I might split
			an article, I might shave sections off certain articles and combine
			them into one article, etc.
			</p>
			<h3>Quantum Mechanics</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>After you've travelled <i>The Road to Quantum Mechanics</i>, you
			arrive at Quantum Mechanics. In this series, we're going to cover
			Quantum Mechanics from its inception to as long as I can keep
			writing. We're going to refer back to <i>The Road to Quantum
			Mechanics</i> throughout this series because we've already done a
			lot of the work.
			</p>
			<p>NOTE: I'm not even close to writing these yet, so take the
			article titles listed below as if they're just topics that we want
			to cover. I will change the order of these articles, remove some,
			add others, and so on. For example, I will definitely spend more
			than one article on Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum
			Chromodynamics each, but I only have it as one article for now
			(though those articles might be intro articles and I'll have them as
			their own arcs).
			</p>
			<h4>Old Quantum Theory</h4>
			<p>At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, we started noticing
			some problems with our models. If we assumed certain parts of nature
			were continuous, we would get answers that were not only wrong, but
			absurd. During the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, we resolved these
			issues with <em>ad hoc</em> solutions. In this arc, we're going to
			talk about these problems and the first attempts of the scientific
			community to resolve these issues.

			</ol>
			<h4>Principles of Quantum Mechanics</h4>
			<p>In this section, we start to move to the modern understanding of
			Quantum Mechanics. During this arc, we'll develop the Principles of
			Quantum Mechanics and apply them to a few important systems.
			</p>
			<ol start="6">

				<li>The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
				<li>The Hydrogen Atom (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Approximation Techniques</h4>
			<p>Besides the systems I've listed and a few others, almost every
			other system in Quantum Mechanics is too difficult to solve exactly.
			To deal with this problem, we have to use various approximation
			techniques.
			</p>
			<ol start="11">
				<li>The Variational Principle (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
				<li>The WKB Approximation (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>

				<li>The Helium Atom (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
				<li>Electron Orbitals and the Periodic Table (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Quantum Dynamics</h4>
			<p>At this point, we know how to find things like energy levels and
			eigenstates, but we want to know how systems change over time.
			Currently, this section is a little dry, so let me know if there are
			other tricks I can bring into the system.

				<li>Fermi's Golden Rule (<span class="not-started">Not Started</span>)</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Quantum Field Theory</h4>
			<p>At this point, it should become clear that this list is
			definitely incomplete and will be revised in the future. For
			example, I've made no mention of the Weak Force at all. I'm
			definitely going to add more to this section and possibly split it
			up. Alternatively, I might keep it as is and give stuff like Quantum
			Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics its own section.

			<p>In this arc, I want to cover the study of solid materials. Our
			goal is to somehow get from a microscopic description of a material
			to its macroscopic physical properties.

			<h4>Density Functional Theory</h4>
			<p>I don't know what exactly I'm going to add here, but I definitely
			know I want to cover it. I'll figure it out when I get here in a
			year or two.
			</p>
			<!--<h4>Do You Really Need to Cover Classical Mechanics?</h4>
			<p>I am not taking the expressway to Quantum Mechanics. I want to
			create a story that people can follow. With that being said, most
			topics I intend to cover will be directly relevant to Quantum
			Mechanics. In my discussion of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, I'll
			introduce the spherical harmonics and Hermitian operators. The
			discussion of electromagnetism and Hamiltonian Mechanics will lead
			naturally into the form of the canonical momentum needed to set up
			the Dirac Equation for a particle in an electromagnetic field. The
			discussion of Optics will lead naturally into the double slit
			experiment and the Born rule.
			</p>
			<p>To be clear, just because these articles are "within" Classical
			Mechanics does not mean that they don't cover Quantum Mechanics. In
			fact, a lot of these articles will have derivations that would fit
			into a Quantum Mechanics textbook with some minor changes. When I
			get to the Quantum Mechanics part of the series, I'm going to be
			able to link back to one of the articles that explains the concept
			in Classical Mechanics. In doing so, I hope to spread out the
			complex parts of Physics so that I don't overload you with one
			million new ideas at the same time.
			</p>
			<p>The few topics I intend to cover that aren't directly relevant
			to Quantum Mechanics will work as scaffolding for other topics,
			either by setting up relevant topics or serving as explicit
			examples of Classical Mechanics topics that show up in Quantum
			Mechanics. For example, the second article in the series covers
			Newtonian Mechanics, which doesn't apply to Quantum Mechanics. You
			don't have forces in Quantum Mechanics, position and velocity
			aren't well-defined, etc. It does, however, set the stage for later
			articles in the series, most notably the article on Lagrangian
			Mechanics. I don't have any plans on explicit examples of Classical
			Mechanics topics, but I'm willing to write an article of that sort
			if anyone wants me to write one.
			</p>
			<h4>That's a Lot!</h4>
			<p>To be clear, you could get by with only some of these articles
			depending on your specific interests. I'm trying to cover everyone
			from people working in Quantum Computing to Solid State Mechanics
			to Computational Physics to Theoretical Physics within one coherent
			framework, so I can't skip any of them.
			</p>
			<p>Also, learning the bare minimum to do one specific thing is a
			bad way to approach a subject. For some reason, people seem to
			think the best way to learn something is to learn a few bare-bones
			ideas utterly unconnected to each other with no explanation.
			Everything you learn becomes a tool that you can use. To throw away
			tools because you see no immediate use for them is short-sighted.
			</p>
			<p>The tool analogy breaks down when you consider that you don't
			know what you don't know. If I see a screw with a weird head, I
			know I need a screwdriver that can handle it. On the other hand, if
			you don't know Linear Algebra, you won't even know that you need to
			learn it to solve the problem.
			</p>
			<p>I'm also leaning towards including extra information because
			people leave out a lot of information in their discussions without
			giving you the resources to figure out the information itself or
			even giving you something to look up. I'll have derivations that
			you won't find elsewhere on the internet or even in some major
			textbooks. By the end of this series, you should understand most of
			the major ideas in modern Physics AND have all the information you
			need to look into these concepts on your own.

			<h3>Real Analysis and Calculus</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>I originally wrote an article on how to derive the Power Rule in
			Calculus from scratch, but the title was inaccurate because I
			relied on the Moore-Osgood Theorem, which is from Real Analysis,
			the field that underpins modern Calculus. Someone pointed this fact
			out, so I decided to write an article proving the Moore-Osgood
			Theorem. That article became three articles. If I decide to write
			more, I'll put them here.
