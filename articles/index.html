			<h2>Articles</h2>
			<p>If you like my work, the easiest way to support me is to read
			and share my articles. Doing so helps out a lot and allows me to
			dedicate more of my time to writing these articles. If you really
			like my work, you can support me by donating to my <a
			href="https://ko-fi.com/josephmellor">kofi account</a>. If you have
			trouble accessing any of the articles, let me know and I'll fix it.
			</p>
			<h3>Newest Articles</h3>
			<p>These are some of my most recent articles. I'm putting them up
			top so you can see what I'm currently working on. Also, the more
			views an article gets in the earliest part of its life, the more
			the algorithm promotes it.

			<p>In this series, I want to talk about my journey from messing
			around with cellular automata led me to a deep understanding of
			Abstract Algebra. I moved this part up because The Road to Quantum
			Mechanics takes up a lot of room.

			<h3>Road to Quantum Mechanics</h3>
			<p>It's a long road to understanding Quantum Mechanics, and there
			are no shortcuts. In this series, I'll show you everything you'll
			need to understand Quantum Mechanics. This series will also serve
			as a good discussion of many major topics in Classical Mechanics.
			I'm also putting the honorable mention <a

			</ol>
			<p>This list is bound to change multiple times as I'm going to
			rearrange the order of the topics and move topics around within the
			articles. For example, I might combine two articles, I might split
			an article, I might shave sections off certain articles and combine
			them into one article, etc.
			</p>
			<h4>Do You Really Need to Cover Classical Mechanics?</h4>
			<p>I am not taking the expressway to Quantum Mechanics. I want to
			create a story that people can follow. With that being said, most
			topics I intend to cover will be directly relevant to Quantum
			Mechanics. In my discussion of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, I'll
			introduce the spherical harmonics and Hermitian operators. The
			discussion of electromagnetism and Hamiltonian Mechanics will lead
			naturally into the form of the canonical momentum needed to set up
			the Dirac Equation for a particle in an electromagnetic field. The
			discussion of Optics will lead naturally into the double slit
			experiment and the Born rule.
			</p>
			<p>To be clear, just because these articles are "within" Classical
			Mechanics does not mean that they don't cover Quantum Mechanics. In
			fact, a lot of these articles will have derivations that would fit
			into a Quantum Mechanics textbook with some minor changes. When I
			get to the Quantum Mechanics part of the series, I'm going to be
			able to link back to one of the articles that explains the concept
			in Classical Mechanics. In doing so, I hope to spread out the
			complex parts of Physics so that I don't overload you with one
			million new ideas at the same time.
			</p>
			<p>The few topics I intend to cover that aren't directly relevant
			to Quantum Mechanics will work as scaffolding for other topics,
			either by setting up relevant topics or serving as explicit
			examples of Classical Mechanics topics that show up in Quantum
			Mechanics. For example, the second article in the series covers
			Newtonian Mechanics, which doesn't apply to Quantum Mechanics. You
			don't have forces in Quantum Mechanics, position and momentum
			aren't well-defined, etc. It does, however, set the stage for later
			articles in the series, most notably the article on Lagrangian
			Mechanics. I don't have any plans on explicit examples of Classical
			Mechanics topics, but I'm willing to write an article of that sort
			if anyone wants me to write one.
			</p>
			<h4>That's a Lot!</h4>
			<p>To be clear, you could get by with only some of these articles
			depending on your specific interests. I'm trying to cover everyone
			from people working in Quantum Computing to Solid State Mechanics
			to Computational Physics to Theoretical Physics within one coherent
			framework, so I can't skip any of them.
			</p>
			<p>Also, learning the bare minimum to do one specific thing is a
			bad way to approach a subject. For some reason, people seem to
			think the best way to learn something is to learn a few bare-bones
			ideas utterly unconnected to each other with no explanation.
			Everything you learn becomes a tool that you can use. To throw away
			tools because you see no immediate use for them is short-sighted.
			</p>
			<p>The tool analogy breaks down when you consider that you don't
			know what you don't know. If I see a screw with a weird head, I
			know I need a screwdriver that can handle it. On the other hand, if
			you don't know Linear Algebra, you won't even know that you need to
			learn it to solve the problem.
			</p>
			<p>I'm also leaning towards including extra information because
			people leave out a lot of information in their discussions without
			giving you the resources to figure out the information itself or
			even giving you something to look up. I'll have derivations that
			you won't find elsewhere on the internet or even in some major
			textbooks. By the end of this series, you should understand most of
			the major ideas in modern Physics AND have all the information you
			need to look into these concepts on your own.
			</p>
			<h3>Big Bois</h3>
			<p>These are articles that I put a lot of effort into, but are
			unfortunately too long, meaning they get rejected by the algorithm.
			To help them survive, I've decided to give them their own section.

			<h3>Real Analysis and Calculus</h3>
			<p>I originally wrote an article on how to derive the Power Rule in
			Calculus from scratch, but the title was inaccurate because I
			relied on the Moore-Osgood Theorem, which is from Real Analysis,
			the field that underpins modern Calculus. Someone pointed this fact
			out, so I decided to write an article proving the Moore-Osgood
			Theorem. That article became three articles. If I decide to write
			more, I'll put them here.
