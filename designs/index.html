				I've had to make a lot of art for my articles and videos.
				Here's some of what I consider to be my best work. You'll find
				rest of it in <a href="/articles/">my articles</a> and on my

				This video is a neat little demonstration that the Mobius strip
				is not orientable, which means that it's possible to travel
				along it and end up back where you started, but flipped. It's
				particularly important for the <a

				Stokes</a> because you non-orientability means that things don't
				cancel and the proof breaks down. Its non-orientability means
				it's also pretty annoying to work with in any digital program,
				but I figured it out.

				This image is my favorite of the several cards I made for the
				separation axioms in my article <a

				the color scheme is great, my handwriting is great, etc.

				Sometimes, it's good to keep it simple, and this animation is a
				prime example. This video shows off the standard coordinate
				systems by showing how the point moves in space as you change
				the coordinates. There's nothing going on here except moving a
				point through space. I do like the color scheme, though.

				This video makes more sense in the context of <a

				which are effectively boxes with some nice rules about their
				boundaries.

				This one was difficult to make until I figured it out. In it, we
				glue together two boxes and have the edges of the box disappear.
				There's also a bit of glowing here so it kind of looks like it's
				getting fused. I would have liked to maybe do a bit more with it
				so it looks like the light is moving around, but it will do for
				what it is.

				This one was probably one of the hardest videos to make. I had
				a few textures for the Earth and I wanted to make them pop out
				like you were peeling them off. If you can show that, it means
				that the surface of the Earth is a manifold since you can find
				open sets that can be mapped to Euclidean space. I got that
				effect, but I had to do some spherical coordinate
				transformations to move the texture around for each disc.
