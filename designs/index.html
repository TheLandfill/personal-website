			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>
				I have three categories for designs: mockups that have yet to
				be made into official websites, generic design templates, and
				official websites. The mockups will be hosted here, but if I've
				made an official website, I'll also link to it. As this is
				currently a static site, I won't be able to implement any
				server code in any mockups.
			</p>
			<h3>Mockups</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/designs/mindandbodyconnections/">Mind and Body
				Connections LLC</a>
					<ul>
						<li>$60 - $90</li>
						<li>Single Page Application</li>
						<li>Completely static site with no server side code
						(i.e. no user databases, shopping carts, payment
						handling, etc.)</li>
						<li>Not set up to be updated frequently</li>
						<li>Had to do some design on my own</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Generic Designs</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/designs/generic/basic-website/">A basic single page website</a>
					<ul>
						<li>$50 - $70</li>
						<li>No moving parts. What you see is what you get.</li>
						<li>Completely static site with no server side code
						(i.e. no user databases, shopping carts, payment
						handling, etc.)</li>
						<li>I give it to you as is. If you want to update it
						frequently, you'll have to make the changes yourself or
						the price will go up.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Official Websites</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://tuacm.com/blog/c-language/word-counter/">Example article from TUACM.com</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Request a Website</h2>
			<p>
				If you would like me to design a website for you, <a
				href="mailto:the.landfill.coding@gmail.com?subject=Request
				Website">email me</a> and we'll discuss rates.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="warning">DISCLAIMER: The price I charge you does
				not include paying for a web domain, the server, or any plan
				from an ISP to serve your website. You will have to pay for it
				on your own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="warning">DISCLAIMER: All prices given here are
				reasonable estimates that should cover most cases, but these
				prices could be higher or lower depending on the amount of
				effort I have to put into the design. I reserve the right to
				decide the final price based on what you specify in the
				design.</span>
			</p>
			<h3>Pricing</h3>
			<p>
				As a baseline, $50 for a well-designed static website that works
				on desktop, tablet, and mobile in all browsers that you don't
				plan to update frequently, $100 if you want a static website
				that does fancy things (including a website you update
				frequently, has a moderate amount of JavaScript/user
				interaction) or if you want some basic server side code (i.e.
				basic user databases, shopping carts, payment handling, a
				counter to indicate how many times someone has visited your
				website, etc.), and $200 if you want a fancy website with basic
				server side code. Anything more complicated than that will
				require at least $200 and depends on what exactly you want me to
				implement. I may not be able to implement your website and I
				will let you know as soon as possible so you can find someone
				else.
			</p>
			<p>
				The actual price of your website will vary between these prices
				depending on the complexity of the work. For example, if you
				want a static website with a little pizzaz or some animations,
				the price will be above $50 but less than $100. If you want a
				little server code (say enough to show a counter for the number
				of the users that have visited your site), then the price will
				be between $50 and $150, but most likely less than $100.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of effort I have to put into the design could lead to
				up to a $30 design cost. If you specify most of the design and
				layout and I just have to write the website, then I will not
				charge you a design cost. I refuse to make a design without a
				basic specification, as I want to avoid the scenario where a
				customer requests X, I make X, and then the customer tells me he
				or she wanted Y.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of effort I have to put into making sure you can
				update your website could lead to up to a $30 set up cost. If I
				only have to send you the files for the website, then I will not
				charge you a set up cost. If I have to figure out how to set up
				your server or I have to set up your website so that you can
				make frequent updates, then I will charge you more.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want a redesign of a website I have already made for you,
				I will treat it as if you wanted another website, but I will
				offer a reduced price depending on the amount of effort I would
				need to put into the redesign. For example, if you just want me
				to change the colorscheme, move things around slightly, change
				some fonts, or add another button, I could do it for about $5 -
				$20. If you want to completely change the layout, $20 - $50. If
				you want me to add some server side functionality to a website
				you originally specified as static, $50 - $200.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you put a visible link to this webpage in a prominent part of
				the website (on every page such as in the footer), I will offer
				a 10% discount on the final cost. If you put a visible link to
				this webpage on a prominent page within the website (say the
				about page or the home page), I will offer a 5% discount. For
				design reasons, I do not recommend doing both, and so I will
				only offer one of these discounts at a time.
			</p>
			<h4>Price Summary</h4>

			</table>
			<h3>Payment</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, I am using Paypal to receive payments. If you don't
				have a Paypal account, you can set one up free of charge by
				following <a
				href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/how-paypal-works/how-to-setup-account">these
				instructions from Paypal</a>. In the invoice and receipt, I
				will list all the specific charges for ease of refunding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do not offer to pay me in exposure.
			</p>
			<h3>Design Process</h3>
			<p>
				As expected, the more complicated the website, the more time it
				will take me to build it. For a simple static site, expect 2 - 4
				days. For a more complicated site, it could take up to a month.
				I will notify you of the expected timeframe as soon as possible.
				If I cannot build the website, I will tell you as soon as
				possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will send me your domain, everything you want on the
				website, and as much of the design as you have. I will discuss
				whether I can implement the website as you want it and suggest
				changes that would be easier to implement and maintain. I will
				create a mockup and send the link to you for your approval. If
				you have any design requests (such as changing the color scheme,
				changing the placement of certain parts of the webpage, etc.),
				then I will implement those changes and send you an updated
				version for your approval. We will repeat this process until we
				reach an agreement or either one of us decides to back out.
			</p>
			<p>
				After you are satisfied with the website I have made, I will
				make sure that you can update your website to the website I
				have made, usually by implementing a dummy version without the
				design. <b>Only after I have made the website and made sure that
				you can update your website will I charge you</b>. After you
				have paid me, I will do what I need to do to set your website
				up.
			</p>
			<h3>Refunds</h3>
			<p>
				If you notice an error, glitch, etc. in the website I made
				within a month of the transaction, I will do what I can to fix
				it for free. If I cannot fix it within two months, I will refund
				the transaction unless you grant me an extension. <b>I will not
				refund a difference in how you wanted the website with the
				website I made if the difference could have been known at the
				time of the transaction</b>. For example, if you request a fix
				for free because the layout is different than what you wanted
				but you accepted the transaction, I will refuse. On the other
				hand, if you request a fix because something about the website
				acted unexpectedly (say the mobile version is misaligned if the
				content takes up too much vertical space), then I will fix it
				for free within two months or refund the transaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the fix requires significantly more work than specified in
				the original transaction, I will renegotiate a deal at a
				discount. If I can't fix it, I will refund all parts of the
				website that are broken. For example, if the front-end of the
				website is fine but the database is broken, then I will refund
				the cost of setting up the database but not the cost of setting
				up the front-end of the website.
			</p>
			<p>
				I reserve the right to refuse to fix something for free if the
				problem lies with a change in any external code, including
				another website's API, an update in a browser, a change in any
				library or framework used in building the site, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				This transaction is immune from the <a
				href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0176-buyers-remorse-when-ftcs-cooling-rule-may-help#exceptions">Cooling-Off
				Rule</a> as it happens entirely online.
			</p>
			<h3>Copyright, License, and Liability</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="warning">DISCLAIMER: The following paragraphs
				are intended to provide a brief overview of the copyright,
				license, and liability rules with explanations for why I have
				these stipulations and are not a substitute for the list
				under <a href="#actual-conditions">Actual Conditions</a>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				As expected, you own anything you bring to the design and I own
				the source code and anything I contribute to the design. You can
				do anything you want with the source code I give you except to
				sell off any part of the source code to someone else or to reuse
				the source code for a separate website. If you give me content
				you do not have permission to use in the design, you will face
				the legal repercussions if I use it in the website, not me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since I don't get paid until after I've already made the mockup,
				I would have spent my time in vain if you decide to cancel the
				deal. In order to keep me from losing as much, I want to add the
				website to my portfolio. For this reason, I reserve the right to
				continue to use anything provided in the design that is
				essential to show my expertise in web development, most notably
				colorschemes, interactive parts of the website, layouts, and
				images similar in color to the ones provided in the design. For
				example, my website would look much worse if the background were
				a bright white or a sunny day, which could scare off potential
				customers. If you owned the background image and revoked my
				permission to use it, I could still use another dark blue image
				with white dots if I had permission to do so. Likewise, one of
				my designs has an image of some people on the left half and a
				grey right half with some patterns on it. While I could not use
				that image if my permission was revoked, I could use any other
				image with a grey right half and people on the right as long as
				I had permission.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I use a third party's content in my mockup that you later use
				in your website, you have an agreement with the third party to
				use the content in your website separate from my agreement with
				the third party to use the content in my mockup. This way, if
				one of us loses permission, the other person can still use the
				content.
			</p>
			<h3 id="actual-conditions">Actual Conditions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You have the copyright of logos, color scheme, images, text,
					videos and other content specified in the design.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have the copyright for all source code (including but not
					limited to HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, PHP,
					WebAssembly, etc.). I do not have the copyright of any
					source code from other people, including libraries,
					frameworks, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Until payment has been rendered, you cannot use the source
					code or any content I create unless explicit permission has
					been given.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the transaction is completed, you can use the source
					code and any images, text, or other content I created
					provided as is, change them, or replace them with someone
					else's work with no limitations. You may not resell or reuse
					the source code as part of some other product unless I give
					explicit permission.
				</li>
				<li>
					After requesting a mockup, you allow me to use any content
					specified in the design that is necessary to demonstrate my
					proficiency in web development (color schemes, layouts,
					user interaction, etc.) in a mockup hosted on my website
					even if you cancel the transaction. I cannot use any text,
					images, videos, logos, or anything else you specified in the
					design that is not required to demonstrate my proficiency in
					web development. Since images also work with the color
					scheme, I can use images with similar colorschemes.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>I am not working for hire.</b> Any content (including source
					code, images, and text) that I create is under my copyright
					and licensed out to you as specified above.
				</li>
				<li>
					I am not liable for any stolen or otherwise illegal content
					(including but not limited to logos, color schemes, images,
					text, videos, and anything else protected under copyright)
					provided to me in the design.
				</li>
				<li>
					If I use content from a third party, you will have a
					separate license with the third party that you will have to
					negotiate after the transaction is complete.
				</li>
